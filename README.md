## Students Team data

Name: faisal saadi

Student Number: 208336321

### Lecturer
*Roi Poranne*

### lab Description

In this lab we are supposed to implement transparency algorithm in computer graphics meshviewer , using opengl and skeleton provided by the lecturer .
The plan is to work approx 8~ hours per week till the end of the semester we expect to start to see results by the 4th week .
The communication between the teams member and the lecturer will be via slack once per 1-2 weeks .

## progress
week 1 13/3/2022 - 20/3/2022 : practicing opengl and searching relevant materials  ( spent 6 hours ).

week 2 : 20/3/2022 - 27/3/2022 : loaded more than one mesh in the viewer , added alpha value controller which is relevant to transparency implementation , study more about transparency and opengl (spent 6 hours ).

week 3 : 27/3/2022 - 3/4/2022 : studying the whole project in order to implement the sort of transparent triangles (spent 8 hours ).

week 4 : 3/4/2022 - 9/4/2022 : still working on the artifacts issue (spent 6 hours).

week 5 : 9/4/2022 - 16/4/2022 : learning and understanding the depth peeling algorithm (spent 8 hours)

week 6 : 16/4/2022 - 23/4/2022 : no progress ( because of holidays )

week 7 : 23/4/2022 - 30/4/2022 : completed the implementation of the depth peeling algorithm , includes building new shaders and framebuffers to implement the algorithm. (more than 10 hours spent !!..)

week 8 : 30/4/2022 - 7/5/2022 : added mesh rotation option , implement dual depth peeling (8 hours spent).

week 9 : 7/5/2022 - 14/5/2022 : finished dual depth peeling , started to search and learn about stochastic transparency (8 hours spent)

week 10 : 14/5/2022 - 21/5/2022 : initialized buffers and started to implement the stochastic tranpsarency algorithm (6 hours spent)

week 11 : 21/5/2022 - 28/5/2022 : still working on stochastic tranpsarency algorithm (6 hours spent)

week 12 : 28/5/2022 - 4/6/2022 : end of semester

summer 1/7/2022 - 31/8/2022 : implemented oit transparency using linked list method .
